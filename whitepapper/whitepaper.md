## Abstract

As blockchain technology evolves toward a multi-chain future, the need for secure, efficient, and flexible cross-chain infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Hiền Lương Bridge presents a comprehensive cross-chain protocol that enables seamless asset transfers, cross-chain lending, and protocol staking across multiple blockchain networks. This paper introduces the architecture, mechanisms, and security features of the Hiền Lương Bridge protocol, which combines proven cryptographic techniques with innovative protocol design to create a robust foundation for the interconnected blockchain ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Multi-Chain Challenge

The blockchain ecosystem has evolved from a competition for chain dominance to a multi-chain paradigm where different networks serve specialized purposes. This evolution has created significant challenges:

1. **Fragmented Liquidity**: Capital is siloed across dozens of blockchain networks
2. **User Experience Friction**: Managing assets across chains creates complexity
3. **Developer Barriers**: Building cross-chain applications requires specialized expertise
4. **Security Concerns**: Cross-chain operations introduce new security vulnerabilities
5. **Capital Inefficiency**: Assets cannot be efficiently utilized across chains

### 1.2 The Hiền Lương Bridge Solution

Named after the historic bridge that once connected North and South Vietnam, Hiền Lương Bridge is designed to unite the fragmented blockchain landscape with a comprehensive protocol stack:

1. **Bridge Core**: Secure and efficient asset transfers between chains
2. **Cross-Chain Lending**: Utilize collateral on one chain to borrow on another
3. **Protocol Staking**: Security and governance layer for protocol participants

The protocol implements multiple bridging strategies, adapting to the specific needs of different asset types and use cases:

- **Normal Mode**: Creates new token representations on destination chains
- **Adapter Mode**: Bridges existing tokens between chains
- **Privacy Mode**: Enables confidential cross-chain transfers (future implementation)

## 2. Protocol Architecture

### 2.1 System Overview

The Hiền Lương Bridge protocol consists of three integrated components:

    subgraph "Protocol Components"
    Bridge[Bridge Core] --- Lending[Cross-Chain Lending]
    Bridge --- Staking[Protocol Staking]
    Lending --- Staking
    end

    subgraph "Layer 0"
    LZ[LayerZero Protocol]
    end

    Bridge --> LZ
    Lending --> LZ
    Staking --> LZ

    LZ --> Chains[Multiple Blockchains]
```

### 2.2 Bridge Core

The Bridge Core is the fundamental component enabling cross-chain asset transfers:

#### 2.2.1 Key Components

- **BridgeCore Contract**: Manages bridge instances and coordinates transfers
- **Token Bridge Protocols**: Specialized contracts for different token types
- **BridgeFactory**: Contract factory for easy deployment of bridge components

#### 2.2.2 Data Structures

```solidity
// Fungible token information
struct FungibleTokenData {
  address contractAddress;
  bool needAdaptation;
  bool isRegistered;
  uint256 totalBridged;
}

// Non-fungible token information
struct NonFungibleTokenData {
  address contractAddress;
  bool needAdaptation;
  bool isRegistered;
  uint256 totalBridged;
}

// Bridge instance data
struct BridgeData {
  address owner;
  uint256 bridgeId;
  string name;
  string description;
  uint256 createdAt;
  bool isActive;
  uint256 totalTransactions;
}
```

#### 2.2.3 Bridge Modes

**Normal Mode**:

- Creates new token representations on destination chains
- Original tokens are locked in the source chain contract
- New tokens are minted on the destination chain
- Ideal for expanding token usage to new ecosystems

**Adapter Mode**:

- Bridges existing tokens between chains where they already exist
- Tokens are locked in the adapter contract on the source chain
- Corresponding tokens are unlocked on the destination chain
- Optimal for established tokens with existing liquidity

### 2.3 Cross-Chain Lending

The Lending Protocol enables capital efficiency across chains:

#### 2.3.1 Key Components

- **SourcePool**: Manages deposits and collateral on the source chain
- **DestinationPool**: Handles borrowing on the destination chain
- **Oracle**: Provides reliable price feeds for assets

#### 2.3.2 Cross-Chain Lending Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SourcePool
    participant MessageLayer as LayerZero
    participant DestPool

    User->>SourcePool: Deposit collateral
    User->>SourcePool: Initiate cross-chain borrow
    SourcePool->>SourcePool: Lock collateral
    SourcePool->>MessageLayer: Send borrow message
    MessageLayer->>DestPool: Deliver message
    DestPool->>DestPool: Validate collateral position
    DestPool->>User: Transfer borrowed assets
```

#### 2.3.3 Interest Rate Model

The lending protocol uses a dynamic interest rate model based on utilization:

```
Utilization = Total Borrowed / Total Deposits

If Utilization <= kink:
    BorrowRate = baseRate + Utilization * multiplier
Else:
    BorrowRate = baseRate + kink * multiplier + (Utilization - kink) * jumpMultiplier

Where:
- baseRate: Minimum borrowing rate when utilization is 0%
- multiplier: Rate of increase in the borrowing rate as utilization increases
- kink: Utilization threshold where the rate increase accelerates
- jumpMultiplier: Higher rate multiplier after passing the kink
```

### 2.4 Protocol Staking

The Staking Protocol secures the bridge and aligns incentives:

#### 2.4.1 Key Components

- **StakingManager**: Central contract coordinating the staking system
- **StakingPool**: Contract holding staked tokens and tracking positions
- **RewardDistributor**: Manages the collection and distribution of rewards
- **GovernanceController**: Enables protocol governance by stakers

#### 2.4.2 Reward Mechanisms

Stakers earn rewards from multiple sources:

- Protocol inflation based on predefined schedule
- Fee sharing from bridge operations
- Interest share from lending protocol

#### 2.4.3 Governance Process

The protocol implements on-chain governance through a proposal and voting system:

1. **Proposal Creation**: Users with sufficient staking can create proposals
2. **Voting Period**: Stakeholders vote for or against proposals
3. **Execution**: If approved, proposals are executed after the voting period
4. **Implementation**: Protocol parameters or contracts are updated

## 3. Cross-Chain Messaging

### 3.1 LayerZero Integration

Hiền Lương Bridge leverages LayerZero's Ultra Light Node (ULN) protocol for secure cross-chain messaging:

1. **Message Passing**: Uses OApp framework for consistent message handling
2. **Endpoint Configuration**: Each contract connects to chain-specific endpoints
3. **Execution Options**: Configurable options for cross-chain execution
4. **Verification**: Multiple validation mechanisms to ensure message integrity

### 3.2 Message Format

Cross-chain messages use a standardized format for consistency:

```solidity
struct BridgeMessage {
  uint256 bridgeId;
  address tokenAddress;
  uint256 amount;
  uint256 tokenId;
  address from;
  address to;
  bool isFungible;
}
```

### 3.3 Message Verification

Messages are verified using multiple mechanisms:

1. **Source Authentication**: Ensures messages come from trusted sources
