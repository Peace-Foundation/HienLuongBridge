### Bridge Issues

   - Submit a support ticket with your transaction hash
   - Include details of source chain, destination chain, and token

#### Missing Tokens After Bridging

If tokens don't appear after a successful bridge:

1. Ensure you're connected to the correct destination network in your wallet
