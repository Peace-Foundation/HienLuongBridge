  <h2>Terminology Reference</h2>
</div>

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Hiền Lương Bridge documentation.

## A

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

The annualized rate of return on an investment, taking into account the effect of compounding interest.

## B

### Base Chain

The blockchain where a token or asset originated, also referred to as the "home chain" or "source chain."

### Batch Bridge

A feature that allows users to bridge multiple tokens in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and simplifying the process.

### Bridge

A protocol that enables the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks.

### BridgeCore

The central contract in the Hiền Lương Bridge protocol that coordinates cross-chain asset transfers and messaging.

### Bridge Factory

A contract that deploys and manages token bridge pairs across multiple chains.

## C

### Chain ID

A unique identifier for a blockchain network, used to distinguish between different networks during cross-chain operations.

### Collateral

Assets deposited by a user as security against a loan, which may be liquidated if the loan terms are not met.

### Collateralization Ratio

The ratio between the value of collateral deposited and the value of assets borrowed, expressed as a percentage.

### Cross-Chain

Referring to operations or interactions that span multiple blockchain networks.

## D

### Destination Chain

The blockchain network where bridged assets are received after a cross-chain transfer.

### Destination Pool

In the lending protocol, a pool on a destination chain where users can borrow assets against collateral on a source chain.

### dApp (Decentralized Application)

An application that runs on a decentralized network rather than being controlled by a single entity.

## E

### ERC20

A standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and EVM-compatible chains.

### ERC721

A standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain and EVM-compatible chains.

### Ethereum

A decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications.

### Execution Layer

The component of a blockchain responsible for executing transactions and smart contract code.

## F

### Fast Mode

A premium bridging option that prioritizes cross-chain messages for faster transfer completion at a higher fee.

### Fee Sharing

A mechanism where protocol fees are distributed to various stakeholders, including stakers and protocol treasury.

### Flash Loan

An uncollateralized loan that must be borrowed and repaid within the same transaction block.

### Fungible Token

A token where each unit is identical and interchangeable with any other unit of the same token (e.g., ERC20).

## G

### Gas

The computational fee required to execute operations on a blockchain network.

### Gas Limit

The maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction.

### Governance

The system by which decisions are made and implemented within a protocol, often involving token holder voting.

### Governance Proposal

A formal suggestion for changing protocol parameters or implementing new features, submitted for community vote.

## H

### Health Factor

A metric representing the safety of a lending position, calculated as the ratio of collateral value to borrowed value, adjusted by liquidation thresholds.

### Hiền Lương Bridge

A comprehensive cross-chain protocol built on LayerZero that enables seamless asset transfer and interoperability across multiple blockchain networks.

### HLB

The native governance token of the Hiền Lương Bridge protocol.

## I

### Interest Rate

The percentage charged or paid for borrowing or lending assets, usually expressed as an annual rate.

### Interest Rate Model

The algorithm that determines borrowing and lending interest rates based on utilization and other factors.

## L

### LayerZero

An omnichain interoperability protocol that enables trustless cross-chain messaging, on which Hiền Lương Bridge is built.

### Lending Protocol

A component of Hiền Lương Bridge that allows users to deposit assets on one chain and borrow on another.

### Liquidity

The ease with which an asset can be converted to cash or other assets without affecting its market price.

### Liquidation

The process of selling collateral to repay a loan when the collateralization ratio falls below the liquidation threshold.

### Liquidation Threshold

The collateralization ratio at which a position becomes eligible for liquidation.

### Lock-up Period

The duration during which staked tokens cannot be withdrawn without penalties.

## M

### Message Fee

The fee paid to LayerZero for cross-chain message delivery, which varies based on destination chain and current gas prices.

### Multi-Chain

Supporting or operating across multiple blockchain networks.

### Multi-Signature (Multisig)

A security feature requiring multiple private key signatures to authorize a transaction or action.

## N

### Native Token

A token that originated on a particular blockchain, as opposed to a wrapped or bridged token.

### Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

A token that represents a unique asset, where each token has distinct characteristics (e.g., ERC721).

### Normal Token

A new token created by the bridge for cross-chain representation, as opposed to an adapter token that wraps existing tokens.

## O

### OApp (Omnichain Application)

An application built on the LayerZero protocol that operates across multiple blockchains.

### OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token)

A token standard for fungible tokens that can exist and operate across multiple blockchains.

### ONFT (Omnichain Non-Fungible Token)

A token standard for non-fungible tokens that can exist and operate across multiple blockchains.

### Optimism

A Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses optimistic rollups to increase transaction throughput and reduce fees.

### Oracle

A service that provides external data to a blockchain, such as asset prices for the lending protocol.

## P

### Peer Address

The contract address of a corresponding bridge component on another blockchain.

### Protocol Fee

A fee charged by the Hiền Lương Bridge protocol for using its services, typically a percentage of the transaction value.

### Privacy Layer

A component of Hiền Lương Bridge that enables private transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.

## Q

### Quorum

The minimum number of votes or participants required for a governance decision to be valid.

## R

### Rebasing Token

A token that automatically adjusts its supply based on price or other factors.

### Recipient

The address that receives tokens or assets after a bridge transfer.

### Risk Parameter

A configurable value that determines the risk profile of the protocol, such as collateralization ratios or liquidation thresholds.

## S

### Source Chain

### Source Pool

In the lending protocol, a pool on a source chain where users deposit collateral to borrow from destination chains.

### Staking

The process of locking tokens in a protocol to earn rewards and/or participate in governance.

### stHLB

## T

### Testnet

A blockchain network used for testing purposes, with tokens that have no real-world value.

### Timelock

A security mechanism that delays the execution of certain actions to allow users time to react.

### Token Bridge
